# BiesClucasPlayBehaviorTimer
BiesClucasPlayBehaviorTimer is a rat timing program, which keeps track of how many seconds rats spend in Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, and how many seconds rats spend freezing, running, sleeping, grooming, wallclimbing, and bathrooming. In this one, we have two rats in a cage, and they play with each other.
